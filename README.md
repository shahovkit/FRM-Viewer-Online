## Different smart centering and simple centering

Simple centering do positions all frames by center, it removes offsets.
Offsets need becouse frames have different sizes and without it will twitch.
Smart centering calculating by tangent and remove only part of offset, but save offset relative to the center.

Original animation tied to position.
With centering you can move your sprite as you want.
No more headaches due to offsets!
